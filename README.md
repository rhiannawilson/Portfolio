Creating a Portfolio Website to showcase my work to date

# RMW Portfolio - Full Stack Engineer

## Description

As someone passionate about building websites, I wanted to create a page that would not only showcase my skills and attributes but also demonstrate my understanding of developing a functional web application. That's why I built this website to offer a convenient way for users to browse my work and see what I can do.

Users can easily access my portfolio and explore the various projects I have worked on. From front-end development to back-end programming, my portfolio will soon cover a wide range of areas to demonstrate my versatility as a developer. For now, this is a single-page site with simplistic styling CSS and HTML.
